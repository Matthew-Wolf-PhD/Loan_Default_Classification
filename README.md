# Loan_Default_Classification
Loan defaults were predicted based on data provided by the MIT Applied Data Science Program. Data was imported, visualized and univariate and bivariate analysis was completed. Data was treated for missing values and outliers, and SMOTE analysis was performed. Different classification models were developed including decision trees, random forests, logistic regression, and K-nearest neighbors classifiers, and the models were compared. Finally, conclusions were drawn and important data features were visualized.
